[Lectio9]
By reason of these words, an hundredfold, some will have that there shall be a~
thousand years after the resurrection, wherein they that have forsaken all~
things shall receive an hundredfold of those things which they have forsaken,~
and shall inherit everlasting life. Such men consider not that though in other~
things this were worthy, as touching wives it is unseemly for it becometh us~
not to think that he that hath forsaken one wife in this world, shall receive an~
hundred wives in that which is to come. But the meaning is this, that every one~
that for the Saviour's sake hath forsaken earthly things, shall receive~
spiritual things which things, being rightly weighed against earthly things,~
are as though an hundredfold were weighed against one.

[Responsory9]
R. There are no speeches nor languages, * where their voices are not heard.
* Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends~
of the world.
V. Your friends O Lord * are made exceedingly honourable: their principality is~
exceedingly strengthened.
R. Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends~
of the world.
&Gloria
R. Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends~
of the world.
