Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 7:31-37
7:31 And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
7:32 And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.
7:33 And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:
7:34 And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.
7:35 And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.
7:36 And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.
7:37 And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
