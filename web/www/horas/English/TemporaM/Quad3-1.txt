v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 4:23-30
4:23 And he said to them: Doubtless you will say to me this similitude: Physician, heal thyself: as great things as we have heard done in Capharnaum, do also here in thy own country.
4:24 And he said: Amen I say to you, that no prophet is accepted in his own country.
4:25 In truth I say to you, there were many widows in the days of Elias in Israel, when heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there was a great famine throughout all the earth.
4:26 And to none of them was Elias sent, but to Sarepta of Sidon, to a widow woman.
4:27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet: and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.
4:28 And all they in the synagogue, hearing these things, were filled with anger.
4:29 And they rose up and thrust him out of the city; and they brought him to the brow of the hill, whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.
4:30 But he passing through the midst of them, went his way.
