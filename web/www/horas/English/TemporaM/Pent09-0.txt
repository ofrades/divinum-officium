Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 19:41-17
19:41 And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:
19:42 If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes.
19:43 For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side,
19:44 And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.
19:45 And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought.
19:46 Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.
19:47 And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him:
19:48 And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
