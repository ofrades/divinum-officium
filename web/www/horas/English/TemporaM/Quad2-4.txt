v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 16:19-31
16:19 There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen; and feasted sumptuously every day.
16:20 And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,
16:21 Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores.
16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.
16:23 And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom:
16:24 And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.
16:25 And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.
16:26 And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.
16:27 And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren,
16:28 That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.
16:29 And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
16:30 But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.
16:31 And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.
