v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:22-38
10:22 And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.
10:23 And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch.
10:24 The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
10:25 Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.
10:26 But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.
10:27 My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me.
10:28 And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.
10:29 That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.
10:30 I and the Father are one.
10:31 The Jews then took up stones to stone him.
10:32 Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?
10:33 The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.
10:34 Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?
10:35 If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;
10:36 Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?
10:37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
10:38 But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
