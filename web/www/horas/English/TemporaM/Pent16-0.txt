Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 14:1-11
14:1 AND it came to pass, when Jesus went into the house of one of the chief of the Pharisees, on the sabbath day, to eat bread, that they watched him.
14:2 And behold, there was a certain man before him that had the dropsy.
14:3 And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?
14:4 But they held their peace. But he taking him, healed him, and sent him away.
14:5 And answering them, he said: Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit, and will not immediately draw him out, on the sabbath day?
14:6 And they could not answer him to these things.
14:7 And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited, marking how they chose the first seats at the table, saying to them:
14:8 When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not down in the first place, lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him:
14:9 And he that invited thee and him, come and say to thee, Give this man place: and then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.
14:10 But when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place; that when he who invited thee, cometh, he may say to thee: Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with thee.
14:11 Because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.
