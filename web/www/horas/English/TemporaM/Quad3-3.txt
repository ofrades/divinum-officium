v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 15:1-20
15:1 THEN came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:
15:2 Why do thy disciples trangress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
15:3 But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? For God said:
15:4 Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.
15:5 But you say: Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.
15:6 And he shall not honour his father or his mother: and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.
15:7 Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:
15:8 This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.
15:9 And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.
15:10 And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand.
15:11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
15:12 Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?
15:13 But he answering them, said: Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
15:14 Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.
15:15 And Peter answering, said to him: Expound to us this parable.
15:16 But he said: Are you also yet without understanding?
15:17 Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?
15:18 But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man.
15:19 For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.
15:20 These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.
