Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:34-46
22:34 But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together:
22:35 And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him:
22:36 Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?
22:37 Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.
22:38 This is the greatest and the first commandment.
22:39 And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
22:40 On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.
22:41 And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,
22:42 Saying: What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him: David's.
22:43 He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:
22:44 The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?
22:45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
22:46 And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
