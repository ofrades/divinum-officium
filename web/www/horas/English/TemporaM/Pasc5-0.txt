Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 16:23-30
16:23 And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.
16:24 Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.
16:25 These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.
16:26 In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:
16:27 For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
16:28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.
16:29 His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.
16:30 Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
16:31 Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?
16:32 Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
16:33 These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.
