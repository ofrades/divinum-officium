Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 18:9-14
18:9 And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:
18:10 Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
18:11 The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.
18:12 I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.
18:13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner.
18:14 I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.
