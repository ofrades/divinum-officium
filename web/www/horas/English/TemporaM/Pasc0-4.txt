v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 20:11-18
20:11 But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,
20:12 And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.
20:13 They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where they have laid him.
20:14 When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus.
20:15 Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, thinking it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
20:16 Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master).
20:17 Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your God.
20:18 Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples: I have seen the Lord, and these things he said to me.
