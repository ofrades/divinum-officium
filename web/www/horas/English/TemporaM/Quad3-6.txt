v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 8:1-11
8:1 AND Jesus went unto mount Olivet.
8:2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them.
8:3 And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,
8:4 And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.
8:5 Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?
8:6 And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.
8:7 When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
8:8 And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.
8:9 But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.
8:10 Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?
8:11 Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.
