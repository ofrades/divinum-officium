v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 20:17-28
20:17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart, and said to them:
20:18 Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death.
20:19 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again.
20:20 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.
20:21 Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.
20:22 And Jesus answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.
20:23 He saith to them: My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.
20:24 And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
20:25 But Jesus called them to him, and said: You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.
20:26 It shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister:
20:27 And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant.
20:28 Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.
