Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 14:15-21
14:15 If you love me, keep my commandments.
14:16 And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.
14:17 The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.
14:18 I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.
14:19 Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.
14:20 In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
