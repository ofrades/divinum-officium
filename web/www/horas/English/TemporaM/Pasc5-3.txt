v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 17:1-11 
17:1 THESE things Jesus spoke, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.
17:2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.
17:3 Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
17:4 I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.
17:5 And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.
17:6 I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.
17:7 Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee:
17:8 Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
17:9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:
17:10 And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.
17:11 And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are.
