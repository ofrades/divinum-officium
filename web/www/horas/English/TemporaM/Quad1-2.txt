v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 21:10-17.
21:10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, the whole city was moved, saying: Who is this?
21:11 And the people said: This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.
21:12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the chairs of them that sold doves:
21:13 And he saith to them: It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.
21:14 And there came to him the blind and the lame in the temple; and he healed them.
21:15 And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying: Hosanna to the son of David; were moved with indignation.
21:16 And said to him: Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus said to them: Yea, have you never read: Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
21:17 And leaving them, he went out of the city into Bethania, and remained there.
