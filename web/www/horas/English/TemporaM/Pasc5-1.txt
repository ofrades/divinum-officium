v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 11:5-13
11:5 And he said to them: Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and shall say to him: Friend, lend me three loaves,
11:6 Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me, and I have not what to set before him.
11:7 And he from within should answer, and say: Trouble me not, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
11:8 Yet if he shall continue knocking, I say to you, although he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend; yet, because of his importunity, he will rise, and give him as many as he needeth.
11:9 And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.
11:10 For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.
11:11 And which of you, if he ask his father bread, will he give him a stone? or a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
11:12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he reach him a scorpion?
11:13 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him?
