v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 17:1-9
17:1 AND after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:
17:2 And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.
17:3 And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.
17:4 And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
17:5 And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.
17:6 And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.
17:7 And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them, Arise, and fear not.
17:8 And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus.
17:9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.
