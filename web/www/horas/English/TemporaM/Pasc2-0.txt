v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:11-16
10:11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.
10:12 But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep:
10:13 And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.
10:14 I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me.
10:15 As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.
10:16 And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.
