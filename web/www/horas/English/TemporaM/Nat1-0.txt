v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:33-40
2:33 And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him.
2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted;
2:35 And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed.
2:36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity.
2:37 And she was a widow until fourscore and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day.
2:38 Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.
2:39 And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their city Nazareth.
2:40 And the child grew, and waxed strong, full of wisdom; and the grace of God was in him.
