Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 10:23-37
10:23 And turning to his disciples, he said: Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see.
10:24 For I say to you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.
10:25 And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him, and saying, Master, what must I do to possess eternal life?
10:26 But he said to him: What is written in the law? how readest thou?
10:27 He answering, said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thyself.
10:28 And he said to him: Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
10:29 But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus: And who is my neighbour?
10:30 And Jesus answering, said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who also stripped him, and having wounded him went away, leaving him half dead.
10:31 And it chanced, that a certain priest went down the same way: and seeing him, passed by.
10:32 In like manner also a Levite, when he was near the place and saw him, passed by.
10:33 But a certain Samaritan being on his journey, came near him; and seeing him, was moved with compassion.
10:34 And going up to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
10:35 And the next day he took out two pence, and gave to the host, and said: Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my return, will repay thee.
10:36 Which of these three, in thy opinion, was neighbour to him that fell among the robbers?
10:37 But he said: He that shewed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him: Go, and do thou in like manner.
