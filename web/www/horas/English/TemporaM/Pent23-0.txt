Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:18-26
9:18 And he was speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler came up, and adored him, saying: Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
9:19 And Jesus rising up followed him, with his disciples.
9:20 And behold a woman who was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment.
9:21 For she said within herself: If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be healed.
9:22 But Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Be of good heart, daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.
9:23 And when Jesus was come into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the multitude making a rout,
9:24 He said: Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
9:25 And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand. And the maid arose.
9:26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that country.
