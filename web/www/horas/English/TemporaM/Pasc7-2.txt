Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 10:1-10
10:1 AMEN, amen I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.
10:2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
10:4 And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
10:5 But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.
10:6 This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke to them.
10:7 Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
10:8 All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.
10:9 I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures.
10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly.
