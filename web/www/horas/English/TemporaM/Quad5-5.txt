v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 11:47-54
11:47 The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?
11:48 If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.
11:49 But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.
11:50 Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
11:51 And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.
11:52 And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.
11:53 From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.
11:54 Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.
