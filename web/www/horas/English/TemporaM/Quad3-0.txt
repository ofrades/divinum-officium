v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 11:14-28
11:14 And he was casting out a devil, and the same was dumb: and when he had cast out the devil, the dumb spoke: and the multitudes were in admiration at it:
11:15 But some of them said: He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils.
11:16 And others tempting, asked of him a sign from heaven.
11:17 But he seeing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself, shall be brought to desolation, and house upon house shall fall.
11:18 And if Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because you say, that through Beelzebub I cast out devils.
11:19 Now if I cast out devils by Beelzebub; by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
11:20 But if I by the finger of God cast out devils; doubtless the kingdom of God is come upon you.
11:21 When a strong man armed keepeth his court, those things are in peace which he possesseth.
11:22 But if a stronger than he come upon him, and overcome him; he will take away all his armour wherein he trusted, and will distribute his spoils.
11:23 He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth.
11:24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through places without water, seeking rest; and not finding, he saith: I will return into my house whence I came out.
11:25 And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished.
11:26 Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and entering in they dwell there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.
11:27 And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman from the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him: Blessed is the womb that bore thee, and the paps that gave thee suck.
11:28 But he said: Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God, and keep it.
