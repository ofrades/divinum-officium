Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 14:13-31
14:13 Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
14:14 If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.
14:15 If you love me, keep my commandments.
14:16 And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.
14:17 The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.
14:18 I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.
14:19 Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.
14:20 In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
14:22 Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?
14:23 Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him.
14:24 He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father's who sent me.
14:25 These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.
14:26 But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.
14:27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.
14:28 You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
14:29 And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.
14:30 I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing.
14:31 But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go hence.
