v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:15-22
18:15 But if thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother.
18:16 And if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more: that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand.
18:17 And if he will not hear them: tell the church. And if he will not hear the church, let him be to thee as the heathen and publican.
18:18 Amen I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.
18:19 Again I say to you, that if two of you shall consent upon earth, concerning any thing whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be done to them by my Father who is in heaven.
18:20 For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
18:21 Then came Peter unto him and said: Lord, how often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
18:22 Jesus saith to him: I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven times.
