v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 8:4-15
8:4 And when a very great multitude was gathered together, and hastened out of the cities unto him, he spoke by a similitude.
8:5 The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
8:6 And other some fell upon a rock: and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
8:7 And other some fell among thorns, and the thorns growing up with it, choked it.
8:8 And other some fell upon good ground; and being sprung up, yielded fruit a hundredfold. Saying these things, he cried out: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
8:9 And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.
8:10 To whom he said: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing may not understand.
8:11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
8:12 And they by the way side are they that hear; then the devil cometh, and taketh the word out of their heart, lest believing they should be saved.
8:13 Now they upon the rock, are they who when they hear, receive the word with joy: and these have no roots; for they believe for a while, and in time of temptation, they fall away.
8:14 And that which fell among thorns, are they who have heard, and going their way, are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and yield no fruit.
8:15 But that on the good ground, are they who in a good and perfect heart, hearing the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit in patience.
