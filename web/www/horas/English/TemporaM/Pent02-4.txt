v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 6:56-59
6:56 For my flesh is meat indeed: and my blood is drink indeed.
6:57 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him.
6:58 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, the same also shall live by me.
6:59 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead. He that eateth this bread, shall live for ever.
