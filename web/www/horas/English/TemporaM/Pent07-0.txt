Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 7:15-21
7:15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
7:16 By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
7:17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
7:18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.
7:19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.
7:20 Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.
7:21 Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.
