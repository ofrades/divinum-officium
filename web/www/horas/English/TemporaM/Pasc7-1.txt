Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 3:16-21
3:16 For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting.
3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him.
3:18 He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
3:19 And this is the judgment: because the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil.
3:20 For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.
3:21 But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they are done in God.
