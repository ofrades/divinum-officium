Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 17:11-19
17:11 And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
17:12 And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;
17:13 And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.
17:14 Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.
17:15 And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God.
17:16 And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan.
17:17 And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine?
17:18 There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.
17:19 And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole.
