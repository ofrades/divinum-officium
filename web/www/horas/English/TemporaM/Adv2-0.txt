v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 11:2-10
11:2 Now when John had heard in prison the works of Christ: sending two of his disciples he said to him:
11:3 Art thou he that art to come, or look we for another?
11:4 And Jesus making answer said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen.
11:5 The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the poor have the gospel preached to them.
11:6 And blessed is he that shall not be scandalized in me.
11:7 And when they went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What went you out into the desert to see? a reed shaken with the wind?
11:8 But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are clothed in soft garments, are in the houses of kings.
11:9 But what went you out to see? a prophet? yea I tell you, and more than a prophet.
11:10 For this is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
