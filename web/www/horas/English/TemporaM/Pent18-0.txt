Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:1-8
9:1 AND entering into a boat, he passed over the water and came into his own city.
9:2 And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the man sick of the palsy: Be of good heart, son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
9:3 And behold some of the scribes said within themselves: He blasphemeth.
9:4 And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your hearts?
9:5 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee: or to say, Arise, and walk?
9:6 But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the man sick of palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
9:7 And he arose, and went into his house.
9:8 And the multitude seeing it, feared, and glorified God that gave such power to men.
