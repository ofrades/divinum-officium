v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 7:1-13
7:1 AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
7:2 Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
7:3 And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.
7:4 For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.
7:5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.
7:6 Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.
7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.
7:8 Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.
7:9 When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.
7:10 But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.
7:11 The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?
7:12 And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.
7:13 Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
