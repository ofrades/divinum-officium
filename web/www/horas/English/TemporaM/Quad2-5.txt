v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 21:33-46
21:33 Hear ye another parable. There was a man an householder, who planted a vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and dug in it a press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen; and went into a strange country.
21:34 And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof.
21:35 And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
21:36 Again he sent other servants more than the former; and they did to them in like manner.
21:37 And last of all he sent to them his son, saying: They will reverence my son.
21:38 But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.
21:39 And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
21:40 When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husbandmen?
21:41 They say to him: He will bring those evil men to an evil end; and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, that shall render him the fruit in due season.
21:42 Jesus saith to them: Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? By the Lord this has been done; and it is wonderful in our eyes.
21:43 Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.
21:44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.
21:45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.
21:46 And seeking to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes: because they held him as a prophet.
