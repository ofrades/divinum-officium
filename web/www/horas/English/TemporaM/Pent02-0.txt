Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 14:16-24
14:16 But he said to him: A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.
14:17 And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited, that they should come, for now all things are ready.
14:18 And they began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him: I have bought a farm, and I must needs go out and see it: I pray thee, hold me excused.
14:19 And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them: I pray thee, hold me excused.
14:20 And another said: I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
14:21 And the servant returning, told these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the feeble, and the blind, and the lame.
14:22 And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
14:23 And the Lord said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
14:24 But I say unto you, that none of those men that were invited, shall taste of my supper.
