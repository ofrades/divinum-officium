v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 13:24-30
13:24 Another parable he proposed to them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seeds in his field.
13:25 But while men were asleep, his enemy came and oversowed cockle among the wheat and went his way.
13:26 And when the blade was sprung up, and had brought forth fruit, then appeared also the cockle.
13:27 And the servants of the goodman of the house coming said to him: Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it cockle?
13:28 And he said to them: An enemy hath done this. And the servants said to him: Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?
13:29 And he said: No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it.
13:30 Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.
