v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 8:21-29
8:21 Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.
8:22 The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come?
8:23 And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.
8:24 Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.
8:25 They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.
8:26 Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.
8:27 And they understood not, that he called God his Father.
8:28 Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak:
8:29 And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him.
