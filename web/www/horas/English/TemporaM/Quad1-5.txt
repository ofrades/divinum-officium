Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 5:1-15
5:1 AFTER these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
5:2 Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.
5:3 In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.
5:4 And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.
5:5 And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.
5:6 Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?
5:7 The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.
5:8 Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.
5:9 And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.
5:10 The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.
5:11 He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
5:12 They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
5:13 But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.
5:14 Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.
5:15 The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
