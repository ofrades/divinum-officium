v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 20:1-16
20:1 THE kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
20:2 And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
20:3 And going about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market place idle.
20:4 And he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be just.
20:5 And they went their way. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.
20:6 But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?
20:7 They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into my vineyard.
20:8 And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.
20:9 When therefore they were come, that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
20:10 But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every man a penny.
20:11 And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,
20:12 Saying: These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.
20:13 But he answering said to one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?
20:14 Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.
20:15 Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thy eye evil, because I am good?
20:16 So shall the last be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.
