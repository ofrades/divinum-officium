v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:1-13
8:1 AND when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him:
8:2 And behold a leper came and adored him, saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
8:3 And Jesus stretching forth his hand, touched him, saying: I will, be thou made clean. And forthwith his leprosy was cleansed.
8:4 And Jesus saith to him: See thou tell no man: but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them.
8:5 And when he had entered into Capharnaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,
8:6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, and is grieviously tormented.
8:7 And Jesus saith to him: I will come and heal him.
8:8 And the centurion making answer, said: Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
8:9 For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers; and I say to this, Go, and he goeth, and to another, Come, and he cometh, and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
8:10 And Jesus hearing this, marvelled; and said to them that followed him: Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith in Israel.
8:11 And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven:
8:12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
8:13 And Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and as thou hast believed, so be it done to thee. And the servant was healed at the same hour.
