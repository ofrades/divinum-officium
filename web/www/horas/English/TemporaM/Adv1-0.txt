Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 21:25-33
21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, by reason of the confusion of the roaring of the sea and of the waves;
21:26 Men withering away for fear, and expectation of what shall come upon the whole world. For the powers of heaven shall be moved;
21:27 And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with great power and majesty.
21:28 But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is at hand.
21:29 And he spoke to them in a similitude. See the fig tree, and all the trees:
21:30 When they now shoot forth their fruit, you know that summer is nigh;
21:31 So you also, when you shall see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is at hand.
21:32 Amen, I say to you, this generation shall not pass away, till all things be fulfilled.
21:33 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
