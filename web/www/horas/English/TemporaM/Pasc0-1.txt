v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 24:13-35
24:13 And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.
24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
24:15 And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them.
24:16 But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.
24:17 And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad?
24:18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?
24:19 To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people;
24:20 And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
24:21 But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
24:22 Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre,
24:23 And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.
24:24 And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not.
24:25 Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken.
24:26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory?
24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him.
24:28 And they drew nigh to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.
24:29 But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.
24:30 And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.
24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.
24:32 And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures?
24:33 And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them,
24:34 Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
24:35 And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread.
