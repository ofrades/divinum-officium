v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 8:23-27
8:23 And when he entered into the boat, his disciples followed him:
8:24 And behold a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves, but he was asleep.
8:25 And they came to him, and awaked him, saying: Lord, save us, we perish.
8:26 And Jesus saith to them: Why are you fearful, O ye of little faith? Then rising up he commanded the winds, and the sea, and there came a great calm.
8:27 But the men wondered, saying: What manner of man is this, for the winds and the sea obey him?
