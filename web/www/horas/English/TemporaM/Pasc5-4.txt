Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 16:14-20
16:14 At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.
16:15 And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
16:16 He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned.
16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues.
16:18 They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover.
16:19 And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God.
16:20 But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.
