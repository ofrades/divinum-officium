v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 20:1-9
20:1 AND on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
20:2 She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
20:3 Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and they came to the sepulchre.
20:4 And they both ran together, and that other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
20:5 And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying; but yet he went not in.
20:6 Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying,
20:7 And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place.
20:8 Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to the sepulchre: and he saw, and believed.
20:9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
