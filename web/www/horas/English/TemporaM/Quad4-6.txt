v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 8:12-20
8:12 Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
8:13 The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.
8:14 Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.
8:15 You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.
8:16 And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
8:17 And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.
8:18 I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.
8:19 They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.
8:20 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
