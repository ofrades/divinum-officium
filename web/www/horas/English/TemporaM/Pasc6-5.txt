Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:26-27; 16:1-4
15:26 But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me.
15:27 And you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning.
16:1 THESE things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized.
16:2 They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to God.
16:3 And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father, nor me.
16:4 But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.
