v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 7:32-39
7:32 The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.
7:33 Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.
7:34 You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.
7:35 The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
7:36 What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?
7:37 And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
7:38 He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
7:39 Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
