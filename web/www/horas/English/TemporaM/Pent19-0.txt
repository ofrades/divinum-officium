Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:1-14
22:1 AND Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying:
22:2 The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son.
22:3 And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage; and they would not come.
22:4 Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come ye to the marriage.
22:5 But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise.
22:6 And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death.
22:7 But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.
22:8 Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.
22:9 Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.
22:10 And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests.
22:11 And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.
22:12 And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? But he was silent.
22:13 Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.
