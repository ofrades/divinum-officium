v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 4:38-44
4:38 And Jesus rising up out of the synagogue, went into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever, and they besought him for her.
4:39 And standing over her, he commanded the fever, and it left her. And immediately rising, she ministered to them.
4:40 And when the sun was down, all they that had any sick with diverse diseases, brought them to him. But he laying his hands on every one of them, healed them.
4:41 And devils went out from many, crying out and saying: Thou art the Son of God. And rebuking them he suffered them not to speak, for they knew that he was Christ.
4:42 And when it was day, going out he went into a desert place, and the multitudes sought him, and came unto him: and they stayed him that he should not depart from them.
4:43 To whom he said: To other cities also I must preach the kingdom of God: for therefore am I sent.
4:44 And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
