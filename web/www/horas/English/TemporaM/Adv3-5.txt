Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:39-47
1:39 And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda.
1:40 And she entered into the house of Zachary, and saluted Elizabeth.
1:41 And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:
1:42 And she cried out with a loud voice, and said: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
1:43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
1:44 For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy.
1:45 And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.
1:46 And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord.
1:47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
