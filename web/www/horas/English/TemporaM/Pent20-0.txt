Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 4:46-53
4:46 He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.
4:47 He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
4:48 Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.
4:49 The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.
4:50 Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.
4:51 And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.
4:52 He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.
4:53 The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.
