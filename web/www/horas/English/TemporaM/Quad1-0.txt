v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 4:1-11.
4:1 THEN Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil.
4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.
4:3 And the tempter coming said to him: If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
4:4 Who answered and said: It is written, Not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.
4:5 Then the devil took him up into the holy city, and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple,
4:6 And said to him: If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written: That he hath given his angels charge over thee, and in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone.
4:7 Jesus said to him: It is written again: Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
4:8 Again the devil took him up into a very high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,
4:9 And said to him: All these will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt adore me.
4:10 Then Jesus saith to him: Begone, Satan: for it is written, The Lord thy God shalt thou adore, and him only shalt thou serve.
4:11 Then the devil left him; and behold angels came and ministered to him.
