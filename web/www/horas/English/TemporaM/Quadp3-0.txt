v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 18:31-43
18:31 Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.
18:32 For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon:
18:33 And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.
18:34 And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.
18:35 Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.
18:36 And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
18:37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
18:38 And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
18:39 And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.
18:40 And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,
18:41 Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.
18:42 And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.
18:43 And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
