v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 15:21-28
15:21 And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
15:22 And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grieviously troubled by the devil.
15:23 Who answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she crieth after us:
15:24 And he answering, said: I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel.
15:25 But she came and adored him, saying: Lord, help me.
15:26 Who answering, said: It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.
15:27 But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.
15:28 Then Jesus answering, said to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from that hour.
