v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 1:19-28
1:19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to him, to ask him: Who art thou?
1:20 And he confessed, and did not deny: and he confessed: I am not the Christ.
1:21 And they asked him: What then? Art thou Elias? And he said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No.
1:22 They said therefore unto him: Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?
1:23 He said: I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaias.
1:24 And they that were sent, were of the Pharisees.
1:25 And they asked him, and said to him: Why then dost thou baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?
1:26 John answered them, saying: I baptize with water; but there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know not.
1:27 The same is he that shall come after me, who is preferred before me: the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.
1:28 These things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
