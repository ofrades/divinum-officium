v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:1-9.
12:1 JESUS therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.
12:2 And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.
12:3 Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
12:4 Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:
12:5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
12:6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.
12:7 Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.
12:8 For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.
12:9 A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
