Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 7:11-16
7:11 And it came to pass afterwards, that he went into a city that is called Naim; and there went with him his disciples, and a great multitude.
7:12 And when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow: and a great multitude of the city was with her.
7:13 Whom when the Lord had seen, being moved with mercy towards her, he said to her: Weep not.
7:14 And he came near and touched the bier. And they that carried it, stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to thee, arise.
7:15 And he that was dead, sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
7:16 And there came a fear on them all: and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet is risen up among us: and, God hath visited his people.
