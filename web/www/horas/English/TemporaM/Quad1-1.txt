v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:31-46
25:31 And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.
25:32 And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:
25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
25:34 Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
25:35 For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:
25:36 Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.
25:37 Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink?
25:38 And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee?
25:39 Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee?
25:40 And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.
25:41 Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.
25:42 For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink.
25:43 I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
25:44 Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
25:45 Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.
25:46 And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting.
