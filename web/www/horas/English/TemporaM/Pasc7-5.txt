Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 5:17-26
5:17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that there were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, that were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was to heal them.
5:18 And behold, men brought in a bed a man, who had the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
5:19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up upon the roof, and let him down through the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus.
5:20 Whose faith when he saw, he said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
5:21 And the scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying: Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
5:22 And when Jesus knew their thoughts, answering, he said to them: What is it you think in your hearts?
5:23 Which is easier to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise and walk?
5:24 But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) I say to thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house.
5:25 And immediately rising up before them, he took up the bed on which he lay; and he went away to his own house, glorifying God.
5:26 And all were astonished; and they glorified God. And they were filled with fear, saying: We have seen wonderful things to day.
