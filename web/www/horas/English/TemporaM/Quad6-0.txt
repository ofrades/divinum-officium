Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 21:1-9
21:1 AND when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto mount Olivet, then Jesus sent two disciples,
21:2 Saying to them: Go ye into the village that is over against you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them and bring them to me.
21:3 And if any man shall say anything to you, say ye, that the Lord hath need of them: and forthwith he will let them go.
21:4 Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
21:5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion: Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to the yoke.
21:6 And the disciples going, did as Jesus commanded them.
21:7 And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their garments upon them, and made him sit thereon.
21:8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way: and others cut boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way:
21:9 And the multitudes that went before and that followed, cried, saying: Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
