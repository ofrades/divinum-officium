Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 23:1-12
23:1 THEN Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,
23:2 Saying: The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses.
23:3 All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do: but according to their works do ye not; for they say, and do not.
23:4 For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens, and lay them on men's shoulders; but with a finger of their own they will not move them.
23:5 And all their works they do for to be seen of men. For they make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge their fringes.
23:6 And they love the first places at feasts, and the first chairs in the synagogues,
23:7 And salutations in the market place, and to be called by men, Rabbi.
23:8 But be not you called Rabbi. For one is your master; and all you are brethren.
23:9 And call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.
23:10 Neither be ye called masters; for one is you master, Christ.
23:11 He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant.
23:12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled: and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
