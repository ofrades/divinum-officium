Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:15-21
22:15 Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech.
22:16 And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou dost not regard the person of men.
22:17 Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
22:18 But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites?
22:19 Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny.
22:20 And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this?
22:21 They say to him: Caesar's. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God, the things that are God's.
