v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 6:1-15
6:1 AFTER these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is that of Tiberias.
6:2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
6:3 Jesus therefore went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
6:4 Now the pasch, the festival day of the Jews, was near at hand.
6:5 When Jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes, and seen that a very great multitude cometh to him, he said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
6:6 And this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he would do.
6:7 Philip answered him: Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.
6:8 One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, saith to him:
6:9 There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves, and two fishes; but what are these among so many?
6:10 Then Jesus said: Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.
6:11 And Jesus took the loaves: and when he had given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down. In like manner also of the fishes, as much as they would.
6:12 And when they were filled, he said to his disciples: Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.
6:13 They gathered up therefore, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.
6:14 Now those men, when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had done, said: This is of a truth the prophet, that is to come into the world.
6:15 Jesus therefore, when he knew that they would come to take him by force, and make him king, fled again into the mountain himself alone.
