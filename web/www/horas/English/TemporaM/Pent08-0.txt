Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 16:1-9
16:1 AND he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.
16:2 And he called him, and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.
16:3 And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.
16:4 I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
16:5 Therefore calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?
16:6 But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
16:7 Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty.
16:8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.
16:9 And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity; that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.
