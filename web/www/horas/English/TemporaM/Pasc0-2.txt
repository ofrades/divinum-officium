v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 24:36-47
24:36 Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I, fear not.
24:37 But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.
24:38 And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
24:39 See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.
24:40 And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.
24:41 But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said: Have you any thing to eat?
24:42 And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.
24:43 And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.
24:44 And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
24:45 Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.
24:46 And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third day:
24:47 And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
