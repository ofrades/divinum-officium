v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 6:47-56
6:47 And when it was late, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land.
6:48 And seeing them labouring in rowing, (for the wind was against them,) and about the fourth watch of the night, he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them.
6:49 But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was an apparition, and they cried out.
6:50 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and said to them: Have a good heart, it is I, fear ye not.
6:51 And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were far more astonished within themselves:
6:52 For they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded.
6:53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genezareth, and set to the shore.
6:54 And when they were gone out of the ship, immediately they knew him:
6:55 And running through that whole country, they began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
6:56 And whithersoever he entered, into towns or into villages or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.
