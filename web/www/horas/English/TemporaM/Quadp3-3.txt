v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 6:16-21
6:16 And when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, sad. For they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.
6:17 But thou, when thou fastest anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
6:18 That thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret, will repay thee.
6:19 Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth: where the rust, and moth consume, and where thieves break through and steal.
6:20 But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven: where neither the rust nor moth doth consume, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.
6:21 For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.
