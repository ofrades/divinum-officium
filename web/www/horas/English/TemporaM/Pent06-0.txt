Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 8:1-9
8:1 IN those days again, when there was a great multitude, and had nothing to eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:
8:2 I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat.
8:3 And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way; for some of them came from afar off.
8:4 And his disciples answered him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness?
8:5 And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven.
8:6 And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples for to set before them; and they set them before the people.
8:7 And they had a few little fishes; and he blessed them, and commanded them to be set before them.
8:8 And they did eat and were filled; and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.
8:9 And they that had eaten were about four thousand; and he sent them away.
