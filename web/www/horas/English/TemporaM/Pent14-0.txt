Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 6:24-33
6:24 No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one, and love the other: or he will sustain the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
6:25 Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than the meat: and the body more than the raiment?
6:26 Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns: and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not you of much more value than they?
6:27 And which of you by taking thought, can add to his stature by one cubit?
6:28 And for raiment why are you solicitous? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin.
6:29 But I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.
6:30 And if the grass of the field, which is to day, and to morrow is cast into the oven, God doth so clothe: how much more you, O ye of little faith?
6:31 Be not solicitous therefore, saying, What shall we eat: or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?
6:32 For after all these things do the heathens seek. For your Father knoweth that you have need of all these things.
6:33 Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God, and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.
