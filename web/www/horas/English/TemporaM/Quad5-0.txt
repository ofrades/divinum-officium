v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 8:46-59
8:46 Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me?
8:47 He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.
8:48 The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
8:49 Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me.
8:50 But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
8:51 Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.
8:52 The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.
8:53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?
8:54 Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.
8:55 And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word.
8:56 Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it, and was glad.
8:57 The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
8:58 Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.
8:59 They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
