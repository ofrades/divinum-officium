v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 12:38-50
12:38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master we would see a sign from thee.
12:39 Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
12:40 For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights: so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
12:41 The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas. And behold a greater than Jonas here.
12:42 The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon here.
12:43 And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none.
12:44 Then he saith: I will return into my house from whence I came out. And coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
12:45 Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man in made worse than the first. So shall it be also to this wicked generation.
12:46 As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
12:47 And one said unto him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking thee.
12:48 But he answering him that told him, said: Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?
12:49 And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said: Behold my mother and my brethren.
12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father, that is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
