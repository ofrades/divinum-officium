v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 16:1-7
16:1 AND when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus.
16:2 And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.
16:3 And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
16:4 And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great.
16:5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.
16:6 Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him.
16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.
