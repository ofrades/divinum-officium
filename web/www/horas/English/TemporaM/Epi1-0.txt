v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 2:42-52
2:42 And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,
2:43 And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not.
2:44 And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance.
2:45 And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.
2:46 And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions.
2:47 And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.
2:48 And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
2:49 And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about my father's business?
2:50 And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them.
2:51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart.
2:52 And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.
