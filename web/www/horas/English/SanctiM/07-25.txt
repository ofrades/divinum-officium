v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 20:20-23
20:20 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.
20:21 Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.
20:22 And Jesus answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.
20:23 He saith to them: My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.
