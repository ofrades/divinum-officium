v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19 
16:13 And Jesus came into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is?
16:14 But they said: Some John the Baptist, and other some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
16:15 Jesus saith to them: But whom do you say that I am?
16:16 Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.
16:17 And Jesus answering, said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
16:18 And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
16:19 And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven.
