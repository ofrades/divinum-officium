v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:24-26
12:24 Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,
12:25 Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.
12:26 If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.
