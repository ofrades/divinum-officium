v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 10:6-22 
10:6 But go ye rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
10:7 And going, preach, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
10:8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: freely have you received, freely give.
10:9 Do not possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your purses:
10:10 Nor scrip for your journey, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor a staff; for the workman is worthy of his meat.
10:11 And into whatsoever city or town you shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till you go thence.
10:12 And when you come into the house, salute it, saying: Peace be to this house.
10:13 And if that house be worthy, your peace shall come upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace shall return to you.
10:14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words: going forth out of that house or city shake off the dust from your feet.
10:15 Amen I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
10:16 Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and simple as doves.
10:17 But beware of men. For they will deliver you up in councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.
10:18 And you shall be brought before governors, and before kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles:
10:19 But when they shall deliver you up, take no thought how or what to speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what to speak.
10:20 For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.
10:21 The brother also shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and shall put them to death.
10:22 And you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake: but he that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved.
