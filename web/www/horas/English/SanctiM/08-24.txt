Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 6:12-19
6:12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and he passed the whole night in the prayer of God.
6:13 And when day was come, he called unto him his disciples; and he chose twelve of them (whom also he named apostles):
6:14 Simon, whom he surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
6:15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon who is called Zelotes,
6:16 And Jude, the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor.
6:17 And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place, and the company of his disciples, and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon,
6:18 Who were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. And they that were troubled with unclean spirits, were cured.
6:19 And all the multitude sought to touch him, for virtue went out from him, and healed all.
