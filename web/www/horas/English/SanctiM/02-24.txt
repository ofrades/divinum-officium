[LectioE]
v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 11:25-30
11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said: I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to the little ones.
11:26 Yea, Father; for so hath it seemed good in thy sight.
11:27 All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no one knoweth the Son, but the Father: neither doth any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal him.
11:28 Come to me, all you that labour, and are burdened, and I will refresh you.
11:29 Take up my yoke upon you, and learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.
11:30 For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.
