[Ant 2]
These are the holy ones * who for the love of Christ, recked nothing of the~
threats of men. In the kingdom of heaven the holy martyrs are filled with joy in~
the company of Angels. O how precious in the sight of the Lord was the death of~
these His saints And now they stand day and night in His presence and are~
not divided the one from the other.

v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 12:1-8
12:1 AND when great multitudes stood about him, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples: Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
12:2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed: nor hidden, that shall not be known.
12:3 For whatsoever things you have spoken in darkness, shall be published in the light: and that which you have spoken in the ear in the chambers, shall be preached on the housetops.
12:4 And I say to you, my friends: Be not afraid of them who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
12:5 But I will shew you whom you shall fear: fear ye him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell. Yea, I say to you, fear him.
12:6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
12:7 Yea, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows.
12:8 And I say to you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.
