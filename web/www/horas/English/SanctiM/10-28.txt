v. Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:17-25
15:17 These things I command you, that you love one another.
15:18 If the world hate you, know ye, that it hath hated me before you.
15:19 If you had been of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
15:20 Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.
15:21 But all these things they will do to you for my name's sake: because they know not him who sent me.
15:22 If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
15:23 He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.
15:24 If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
15:25 But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law: They hated me without cause.
